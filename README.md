# Project Name

`TeamBalancer` or Fair Team Distribution App is a web application developed using JavaScript that aims to create two equally balanced teams based on the skill levels of players. The app allows users to input player names and their corresponding skill levels, and then employs an algorithm to distribute the players into two teams.

The app follows a two-step process to achieve fair team distribution. First, it ensures that both teams have an equal number of players. This helps maintain a balanced playing field by preventing one team from having a numerical advantage over the other. Once the teams have an equal number of players, the app distributes the players based on their skill levels to ensure fairness in terms of skill distribution.

The algorithm used in the app sorts the players in descending order of skill level. It then iterates through the sorted player list, assigning each player to the team with the lower cumulative skill level. This approach helps balance the overall skill levels of the two teams, making the match competitive and enjoyable for all participants.

By providing a user-friendly interface with input fields for player names and skill levels, along with a distribution algorithm that prioritizes fairness, the `TeamBalancer` simplifies the process of creating balanced teams for various team-based activities, such as sports events, gaming competitions, or group projects.

## Installation

To install the `TeamBalancer`, follow these instructions:

1. Download the project files: Obtain the project files from the source, either by downloading the zip file from a repository or cloning the project using Git.

2. Set up the project structure: Extract the downloaded zip file (if applicable) and navigate to the project folder.

3. Open the project in a code editor: Use a code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text) to open the project folder.

4. Set up a local development server (optional): If you want to run the app on a local development server, ensure you have a server environment set up. You can use tools like Node.js or Python's SimpleHTTPServer to serve the app locally. Alternatively, you can directly open the HTML file in a web browser without a local server.

5. Open the HTML file: Locate the HTML file (e.g., index.html) in the project folder and open it in a web browser or by launching the local development server.

6. Interact with the app: Once the app is open in the browser, you'll see the interface with options to add player names and skill levels. Use the "Add Player" button to enter the details for each player. The app will display the selected skill level when you choose it from the dropdown menu. Continue adding players until you have included all the participants.

7. Click the "Get Teams" button: After adding all the players, click the "Get Teams" button. The app will distribute the players into two teams, ensuring equal team sizes and fair skill distribution.

8. View the team results: The app will display the two teams with their respective player names and skill levels. You can observe how the algorithm has distributed the players to create balanced teams.

## Usage
